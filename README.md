# Retrospective Analysis IDA Pro Plugin

**Retrospective Analysis** is a plugin for **IDA Pro** that accelerates and simplifies reverse engineering. It performs a comprehensive backward analysis of function calls using a layered system, predicts and modifies function types, and removes unused parameters. The analysis starts directly from the **context menu of the decompiled view**, ensuring a seamless integration into your workflow.

---

### Features

#### üîç Function Call Layer Analysis  
The analysis begins from the selected function and iteratively scans the call hierarchy up to a user-defined depth (1‚Äì10 layers). Each layer represents a group of function calls, enabling detailed examination of call relationships.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Parameter Optimization  
Analyzes function call types (e.g., `__thiscall`, `__stdcall`), modifies them, and removes unused parameters afterward.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Function Call Type Analysis  
Identifies inconsistencies and common patterns in function call types to improve function signatures.

#### üöÄ Unused Parameter Analysis in Call References  
Detects and removes redundant parameters from call references, ensuring cleaner and more optimized function signatures.

#### üîÑ Enhanced Backward Analysis Engines  
Choose the best approach for your analysis with two user-selectable engines:
- **Hex-Rays Compiler Based Engine:** Utilizes the Hex-Rays library to backward compile functions and analyze calls.
- **IDA API Based Engine:** Analyzes raw machine code to backward compile functions and inspect call relationships.

#### üîß Automated Virtual Call Corrections  
Automatically corrects virtual call types and parameters, deleting any unused parameters for a more accurate signature.

#### ‚ö° Improved Call Type and Parameter Analysis  
Incorporates new methods for enhanced accuracy in determining call types and parameters. This update now supports the previously unsupported **usercall** and **userpurge** rules, allowing for more effective detection and correction of signature issues.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Easy Integration  
Start the analysis directly from the context menu in the decompiled view.

#### üîÑ Automatic Refresh  
The decompiled view is automatically refreshed after any modifications.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](#).  
2. Place the plugin file in the `plugins` directory of your IDA Pro installation.  
3. Restart IDA Pro. The plugin will then appear in the context menu of the decompiled view.
