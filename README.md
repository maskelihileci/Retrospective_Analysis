Retrospective Analysis Plugin for IDA Pro
Retrospective Analysis is a plugin for IDA Pro, designed to enhance the reverse engineering process. By analyzing function call chains and optimizing parameter usage, this plugin provides invaluable insights for reverse engineers seeking to streamline their analysis workflow.

The analysis can be initiated directly from the decompiled view's context menu, offering seamless integration with your existing workflow.

Features
üîç Function Call Layer Analysis
The analysis starts from the selected function and iteratively traverses its call hierarchy for a user-specified depth (1-10 layers). Each layer represents a set of function calls, enabling detailed inspection of call relationships.

üõ†Ô∏è Parameter Optimization
Analyzes function call types (e.g., __thiscall, __stdcall) and identifies unused parameters only after modifying the function type. It then suggests the removal of those parameters.

‚öôÔ∏è Function Call Type Analysis
Analyzes function call types and detects inconsistencies or common patterns to improve the function‚Äôs signature.

üñ•Ô∏è Seamless Integration
Launch analysis directly from the decompiled view‚Äôs context menu (as shown in the screenshot).

üîÑ Auto Refresh
Automatically updates decompiler views after changes.

How to Use
Select a Function
Open the decompiled view in IDA Pro and right-click on the function you want to analyze.


Start Analysis
From the context menu, select Retrospective Analysis.

Configure Analysis
Adjust the analysis depth (1-10 layers) and start the analysis.

Review Results
The plugin highlights unused parameters and call type inconsistencies. Review these in the console or decompiled view.

Known Limitations
Virtual Call Handling
Virtual calls must be manually adjusted for now.

Return Type Analysis
Planned for future releases.

Accuracy
While the analysis achieves ~80% accuracy in identifying unused parameters, manual review is recommended.

Installation
Download the latest release from GitHub Releases.
Place the plugin file in the plugins directory of your IDA Pro installation.
Restart IDA Pro. The plugin will appear in the context menu of the decompiled view.
Future Improvements
Automating virtual call type corrections (This must currently be done manually because I haven‚Äôt yet identified which library or function can be used to modify these virtual call types).
Adding return type analysis functionality.
Contribute
Contributions are welcome! Fork the repository and submit a pull request to help improve the plugin. Feedback and suggestions, especially regarding virtual call automation and return type analysis, are highly appreciated.
